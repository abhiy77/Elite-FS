 * REFERENCE - HACKERRANK PROBLEM - (STORY OF A TREE)
 * 
Input Format:
-------------
    - The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.

    - next 'N-1' lines contain two space-separated integers, s and e , 
      defining an undirected edge between nodes s and e .

    - Next line contains two space-separated integers p and q
      describing the respective values of p (the number of guesses) 
      and q (the minimum score needed to win).

    - Next 'p' lines contains two space-separated integers, s and e,
    indicating guesses parent(e)=s.


Output Format :
---------------
    - Print the probability as a reduced fraction in the format m/n .

Note: Print 0/1 if the probability is 0 and print 1/1 if the probability is 1.
