/* 22/09/2020 - (ELITE DAY - 124)
Ganesh is working on numbers,
He is given a list of integers 1,2,3,...,N, the list is indexed from 1 to N.

Now he can shuffle the list in whatever way he want.
Shuffled list is said to be valid, if one of the following is true for i-th position in the list.
	- The integer at the i-th position is divisible by i.
	- i is divisible by the integer at the i position.

Now your task is to find out, How many valid shuffles can Ganesh do?

Input Format:
-------------
An integer N, where N<=20.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, number of ways ganesh can shuffle.


Sample Input:
---------------
2

Sample Output:
----------------
2

Explanation:
------------
The first shuffled list is [1, 2]:
Integer at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).
Integer at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second shuffled list is [2, 1]:
Integer at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).
Integer at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
